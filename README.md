# NonSenseSentenceGenerator

This is a command-line application designed to generate sentences. The name is Nonsense Sentence Generator. The core functionality will involve pre-defined, different lists of various parts of speech such as nouns, verbs, adjectives, articles, adverbs, and prepositions. The program will then randomly select words from these lists and combine them according to a set of pre-programmed, simple grammatical sentence templates.
